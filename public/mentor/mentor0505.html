<h3>Why groupoids?</h3>
For a student learning algebraic geometry, it can sometimes
seem as if the subject in its modern formulation is overwhelmingly
abstract.  While we may be interested in solutions to polynomial
equations, we study schemes, and then the much more abstract notions
of algebraic space and stacks.  I will try to motivate in this talk
why these more general objects are natural to consider, and even
indispensable.
