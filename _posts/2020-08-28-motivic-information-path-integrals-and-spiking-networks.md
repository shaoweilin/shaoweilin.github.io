title: Motivic information, path integrals and spiking networks

I'm writing a series of posts that will explore the connections between these topics. Here is a rough outline of the series, which I will fill in slowly over time.

## Motivic Information

1. [Building foundations of information theory on relative information](https://shaoweilin.github.io/building-foundations-of-information-theory-on-relative-information/)
2. [Conditional relative information and its axiomizations](https://shaoweilin.github.io/conditional-relative-information-and-its-axiomatizations/)
3. [Zeta functions, Mellin transforms and the Gelfand-Leray form](https://shaoweilin.github.io/zeta-functions-mellin-transforms-and-the-gelfand-leray-form/)
4. [Motivic relative information](https://shaoweilin.github.io/motivic-relative-information/)

## Path Integrals

1. [Path integrals and continuous-time Markov chains](https://shaoweilin.github.io/path-integrals-and-continuous-time-markov-chains/)
2. [Biased stochastic approximation](https://shaoweilin.github.io/biased-stochastic-approximation/)

## Spiking Networks

1. [Machine learning with relative information](https://shaoweilin.github.io/machine-learning-with-relative-information/)
2. [Process learning with relative information](https://shaoweilin.github.io/process-learning-with-relative-information/)
3. [Relative inference for mutable processes](https://shaoweilin.github.io/relative-inference-with-mutable-processes/)
4. [Biased stochastic approximation for mutable processes](https://shaoweilin.github.io/biased-stochastic-approximation-with-mutable-processes/)
5. [Convergence of biased stochastic approximation](https://shaoweilin.github.io/convergence-of-biased-stochastic-approximation/)
6. [Spiking neural networks](https://shaoweilin.github.io/spiking-neural-networks/)
