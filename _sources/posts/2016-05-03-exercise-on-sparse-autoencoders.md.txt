# Exercise on sparse autoencoders

## Exercise 1
This exercise is the first of several posts I am writing, for those who want a mathematical and hands-on introduction to deep neural networks.

1. Read the series of notes on the topic of "Sparse Autoencoder" in the [UFLDL Tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial).
2. Complete the exercise at the end of the series, using Python, not Matlab. Sai Ganesh and I have prepared the instructions for a Python-based exercise, together with the relevant data and source code template.

   * [sparseautoencoder-exercise.pdf](https://w3id.org/people/shaoweilin/public/sparseautoencoder-exercise.pdf)
3. Please email me if you would like the Python solution for the above exercise
