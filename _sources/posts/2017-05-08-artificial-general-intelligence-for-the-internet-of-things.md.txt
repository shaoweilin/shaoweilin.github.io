# Artificial general intelligence for the internet of things

## Abstract
What do we need to achieve artificial general intelligence? How do we distribute intelligence over the internet-of-things? We'll dive deep into the heart of the matter, which is machine reasoning. Following recent advances in mathematical foundations and homotopy type theory, we conclude that the crux is to formally separate intents from implementations. We can teach neural networks to understand these intents and to use a divide-and-conquer method for compiling these intents into implementations. Our goal is to outline a distributed strategy for accomplishing this moonshot.
