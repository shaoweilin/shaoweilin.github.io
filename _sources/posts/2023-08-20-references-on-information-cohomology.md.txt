# References on information cohomology

Some references on the cohomological nature of various information theoretic concepts such as entropy and relative information.

## Markov categories

Markov categories were defined by Fritz {cite}`fritz2020synthetic`.

Perrone on Markov categories and entropy {cite}`perrone2022markov`.

Kochen reconstructs quantum mechanics using sigma complexes {cite}`kochen2015reconstruction`.

# Information cohomology

Homological nature of entropy by Baudot and Bennequin {cite}`baudot2015homological`.

Generalized information structures by Vigneaux {cite}`vigneaux2017information`. Vigneaux's PhD thesis can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07807v1.pdf).

Bradley describes entropy as a topological operad derivation {cite}`bradley2021entropy`.
