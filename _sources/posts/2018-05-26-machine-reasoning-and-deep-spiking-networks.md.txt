# Machine reasoning and deep spiking networks

### Abstract
This is a short presentation which I shared at the Visions of AI Futures workshop organized by AI Singapore. I talked about the goal of building next-generation machine intelligence, through neural and symbolic modules that work seamlessly together to accomplish intuitive reasoning, as well as efficient, effective neural chips for every device.
