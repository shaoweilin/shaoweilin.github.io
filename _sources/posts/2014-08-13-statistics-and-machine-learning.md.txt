# Statistics and machine learning

Below are some introductory texts for probability, statistics, machine learning and statistical learning theory. They are sorted roughly according to difficulty, so you can find a book that is suitable for where you are and what you need.

1. [A First Course in Probability (9th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Probability-9th-Edition/dp/032179477X/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)<br />
_Sheldon M. Ross_<br />
This book covers combinatorics and stuff. For undergraduates. Might be too easy.

2. [Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists (4th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Statistics-Engineers-Scientists/dp/0123704839)<br />
_Sheldon M. Ross_<br />
This book covers more advanced topics. Lots of examples.

3. [Probability and Statistics, 4/E](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Probability-and-Statistics-4E/9780321500465.page)<br />
_Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish_<br />
An alternative to (1), (2). More systematic but it doesn’t cover advanced topics like (2). This book was used by MIT for the following [course](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Probability-and-Statistics-4E/9780321500465.page). There are some simplified lecture notes on the course website. 

4. [Probability, Statistics, Statistical learning](https://w3id.org/people/shaoweilin/public/cmnd1SLT.pdf)<br />
[Graphical Models](https://w3id.org/people/shaoweilin/public/cmnd3GM.pdf)<br />
_Shaowei Lin_<br />
Here are some introductory slides I made for a summer workshop at Notre Dame University in 2013 to undergraduate math students.

5. [An Introduction to Graphical Models (not yet published)](https://www.sites.google.com/site/kittipat/good-machine-learning-resources/anintroductiontographicalmodels)<br />
_Michael Jordan_<br />
The author is my FAVORITE guy on statistical learning. Assumes knowledge of probability and statistics, see (1), (2) and (3). Jordan has some [old slides](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/barbados/jordan-tut.pdf) for a tutorial he was teaching. 

6. [All of Statistics](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/)<br />
_Larry Wasserman_<br />
Good broad graduate or advanced undergraduate textbook.

7. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)<br />
_Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani_<br />
Standard introductory UNDERGRADUATE text for statistical learning. Assumes knowledge of probability and statistics, see (1), (2) and (3).

8. [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (2nd Edition)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)<br />
_Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman_<br />
Standard introductory GRADUATE text for statistical learning. Assumes knowledge of probability and statistics, see (1), (2) and (3). If you master this textbook, you can truly be an expert in machine learning.

9. [StatLect: Lectures on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics](http://www.statlect.com/)<br />
_Marco Taboga_<br />
An advanced online textbook on Statistics. 

10. [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/pte.html)<br />
_Rick Durrett_<br />
Formal treatment of probability theory.

11. [Probability and Measure](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Measure-Patrick-Billingsley/dp/1118122372)<br />
_Patrick Billingsley_<br />
Formal treatment of probability theory.

12. [Mathematical Statistics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953823)<br />
_Jun Shao_<br />
Formal treatment of probability theory.
