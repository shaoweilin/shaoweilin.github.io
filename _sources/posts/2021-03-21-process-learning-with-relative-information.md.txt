# Process learning with relative information

Over the next few posts, we will derive a distributed learning algorithm for spiking neural networks with [mutable](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/#why-should-we-consider-mutable-variables-rather-than-latent-variables) variables that minimizes some natural notion of relative information and provably converges over time. We will model these spiking neural networks with stochastic processes: both discrete-time and continuous-time processes, with or without mutable variables.

In this post, we give a general overview of information-theoretic approaches to training stochastic processes, while postponing discussions about issues that arise from mutable variables.

The actual process that generates the data could possibly be different from the model that we are training on the data. This problem is called model misspecification, which we are not addressing in this series. Our goal is to find a distribution in the model that fits the data well according to some sensible metric.

This post is a continuation from our [series](2020-08-28-motivic-information-path-integrals-and-spiking-networks/) onÂ spiking networks, path integrals and motivic information.

## How do we train a stochastic process using relative information?

Suppose that we have a stochastic process $ \{X_t\}$ where $ X: I \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ is a map from some time interval $ I \subset \mathbb{R}$ to some state space $ \mathcal{X}$. If $ I$ is the continuous interval $ [0, T],$ then $ X$ is a continuous-time stochastic process. If $ I$ is the discrete interval $ \{0, 1, \ldots, T\},$ then $ X$ is a discrete-time stochastic process.

Let the true distribution of $ \{X_t\}$ be given by some path measure $ Q_*(\gamma)$ over paths $ \gamma : I \rightarrow R$. Suppose that we have a model or a family of path measures $ P_\theta(\gamma)$ parametrized by $ \theta \in \Theta.$ We also assume absolute continuity for our model, i.e. $ Q_* \ll P_\theta$ for all $ \theta$. This assumption is trivially satisfied if each model distribution assigns a non-zero measure to every cylinder in the sigma-algebra of our path space. Let $ X_{a\ldots b}$ denote the stochastic process over the interval $ [a,b]$, i.e. the family $ \{X_t\}_{t \in [a,b]}.$

Because we have absolute continuity, the Radon-Nikodym derivative $ dQ_*/dP_\theta$ exists, and we may define the time-averaged relative information

$$\displaystyle \frac{1}{T} I_{Q_*\Vert P_\theta}(X_{0\ldots T}) = \frac{1}{T} \int \log \frac{dQ_*}{dP_\theta} dQ_*. $$

To find the best model distribution $ P_\theta$ for approximation the true distribution $ Q_*$, we will minimize this relative information with respect to $ \theta$. As the time horizon $ T$ tends to infinity, we may also consider minimizing the limit of the time-averaged relative information

$$\displaystyle \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} I_{Q_*\Vert P_\theta}(X_{0\ldots T}).$$

## How do we train a stochastic process using relative information rate?

In discrete time, by the chain rule ([CR](2020-09-18-conditional-relative-information-and-its-axiomatizations/#mjx-eqn-CR)), the relative information decomposes into the sum

$$ \begin{array}{rl} I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots n}) &= I_{Q \Vert P}(X_n \vert X_{0\ldots (n-1)}) \\ & \\ & \quad + I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{n-1} \vert X_{0\ldots (n-2)}) \\ & \\ & \quad + \cdots + I_{Q \Vert P}(X_1 \vert X_0) +I_{Q \Vert P}( X_0). \end{array}$$

In continuous time, we have the analogous result

$$ \displaystyle I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T}) = \int_0^T \frac{d}{ds}I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots s}) \,ds $$

where

$$ \begin{array}{rl} &\displaystyle \frac{d}{ds}I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{0\ldots s}) \\ & \\ &= \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\delta} \left[ I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{0\ldots s+\delta}) - I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{0\ldots s})\right] \\ & \\ &= \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\delta} I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{s\ldots s+\delta}\vert X_{0\ldots s}) \end{array}$$

is also known as the _relative information rate_ of $ X_t$. The differential operator acting on the function $ I_{Q \Vert P}$ of the path $ X_{0\ldots s}$ may be seen as a generalization of the infinitesimal generator for Markov processes.

In fact, using Kingman's subadditive ergodic theory {cite}`leroux1992maximum`, we can show that under mild regularity conditions,

$$ \displaystyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots n}) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} I_{Q \Vert P}(X_n \vert X_{0\ldots (n-1)}).$$

In continuous time, we have the corresponding relation

$$ \displaystyle \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T}) = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{d}{dT}I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T}).$$

This gives us an asymptotic relationship between relative information and relative information rate.

Hence, to learn a strongly-stationary stochastic process, instead of minimizing the relative information to $ Q_*$ from $ P_\theta$, we may minimize their relative information rate. We will assume strong stationarity for the rest of this series.

In the case where we do not have strong stationarity, it will be hard to guarantee convergence of the learning algorithm. Greedily minimizing the terms $I_{Q \Vert P}(X_t \vert X_{0\ldots (t-1)})$ of the decomposition

$$ \begin{array}{rl} I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{0\ldots n}) &= I_{Q \Vert P}(X_n \vert X_{0\ldots (n-1)}) \\ & \\ & \quad + I_{Q \Vert P}(X_{n-1} \vert X_{0\ldots (n-2)}) \\ & \\ & \quad + \cdots + I_{Q \Vert P}(X_1 \vert X_0) +I_{Q \Vert P}( X_0). \end{array}$$

may not help in minimizing the asymptotic time-averaged relative information, since a parameter update to reduce $I_{Q \Vert P}(X_t \vert X_{0\ldots (t-1)})$ may cause earlier terms $I_{Q \Vert P}(X_s \vert X_{0\ldots (s-1)}), s < t,$ to increase more than the amount reduced. Getting this balance to work with stochastic updates is tricky and will require some kind of stationarity as well as new mathematical techniques from the field of biased stochastic approximation.

Note that the relative information rate does not depend on the initial distributions $ Q(X_0)$ and $ P(X_0).$ Therefore, by using the time-averaged relative information (or equivalently the relative information rate) as the learning objective, we are declaring that our main focus is learning the transition kernel of the true distribution.

I prefer to write the relative information rate as

$$ \displaystyle \frac{d}{ds}I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{0\ldots s}) = \frac{d X_{0\ldots s}}{ds} * \frac{\partial}{\partial X_{0\ldots s}} I_{Q \Vert P} (X_{0\ldots s})$$

where $ *$ is the inner product in some appropriate Hilbert space and

$$ \displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial X_{0\ldots s}} F (X_{0\ldots s})$$

is the functional derivative of a path function $ F$ with respect to the path $ X_{0\ldots s}.$ We will formalize the Hilbert space and functional derivative in another post.
