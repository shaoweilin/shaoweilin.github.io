# Relative inference with mutable processes

We introduce a information-theoretic objective, which is a form of relative information between a discriminative model and a generative model, for learning processes using models with [mutable](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/#why-should-we-consider-mutable-variables-rather-than-latent-variables) variables. This technique is known as [relative inference](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/#why-do-we-need-a-better-name-for-variational-inference) (also called approximate inference, variational inference or variational Bayes). Such a technique is useful, for instance, for learning processes that contain latent variables.

We discuss natural constraints on the discriminative and generative models, and the consequences of these constraints on:

- passive/active learning;
- online/offline learning; 
- learning with limited/unlimited memory;
- learning with limited/unlimited sensing.

This post is a continuation from our [series](2020-08-28-motivic-information-path-integrals-and-spiking-networks/) onÂ spiking networks, path integrals and motivic information.

## What is a mutable process?

Suppose we have a random variable $X$ which represents the state of reality, the environment or the universe. This random variable may have components which are observed (data is given) or observable (data can be obtained if we want it), and it may also have components which are latent or hidden. Let the true distribution of $X$ be $Q_*(X),$ which may be partially unknown or fully unknown. For now, we assume that we are passive observers incapable of changing this distribution.

Suppose that we have a generative model $\{P(Z,X)\}$ where $Z$ is an auxiliary variable introduced to increase the model's ability to approximate the true distribution. More precisely, we want to find a distribution $P(Z,X)$ in the model such that the marginal $P(X)$ is as close to the true distribution $Q_*(X)$ as possible. Here, we may assume that closeness is measured by relative information.

The auxiliary variable or memory $Z$ need not reflect actual latent variables in the enviroment $X.$ We are not looking for guarantees that the learning algorithm will infer the true hidden states of $X$. Our only goal is to approximate the true distribution.

To solve this problem, we will introduce a discriminative model with mutable variables. In a model $\{Q\}$, a variable $Z$ is _mutable_ given $X$ if the conditional distribution $Q(Z \vert X)$ is known in the model and if there exists at least two distributions where $Q(Z \vert X)$ is different. The first condition involves knowability, the second condition involves changeability; together, they describe controllability. 

If we also assume that in the model, all marginals $Q(X)$ are equal to the true distribution $Q_*(X),$ then it follows that the joint distribution $Q(Z,X)$ factors as

$$
Q(Z,X) = Q(Z\vert X)Q_*(X).
$$

Intuitively, the model $\{Q\}$ represents a class of stochastic algorithms $Q$ which takes an input $X$ and uses the information to update the auxiliary memory variable $Z$ in a stochastically predictable way. We say that the model is _mutable._

A model for a process $\{Y_t\}$ is _mutable_ if we can find subprocesses $\{Z_t\}, \{X_t\}$ such that $\{Z_t\}$ is mutable given $\{X_t\}.$ When the model is clear from the context, we abuse notation and say that the process itself is mutable.

We will show in this post that we can train generative models $\{P(Z,X)\}$ using mutable processes $\{Q(Z,X)\}$ and relative inference.


## How do we perform relative inference with mutable processes?

Suppose that we have two processes -- the environment $X_t \in \mathcal{X},$ and the memory $Z_t \in \mathcal{Z}$. Let $Q_*(X_{0\ldots T})$ be the true distribution of $X_{0\ldots T}$. Suppose that we have a generative model $\{P(Z,X)\}.$ Recall that our goal is to find a distribution in the model that minimizes the relative information

$$\displaystyle I_{Q_*\Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T})$$

(or equivalently the relative information rate if we assume strong stationarity.)

[Previously](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/), we discussed how this optimization problem over the space of distributions on $X$ may be lifted to an optimization problem over the space of distributions on $(Z,X)$ using [relative inference](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/#why-do-we-need-a-better-name-for-variational-inference). For processes, this involves lifting the environment $X_{0\ldots T}$ to a mutable process $(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T}).$


Specifically, we will be considering different models $\Delta$ of discriminative distributions 

$$Q(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T}) = Q_*(X_{0\ldots T}) Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$$

and attempt to minimize the joint relative information

$$I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T})$$

as $Q$ varies over the space $\Delta.$ We will focus on design considerations for the different computational constraints on $\Delta.$

## Is relative inference necessarily passive?

The form of relative inference we are considering here is passive by assumption. The true distribution $Q_*(X_{0\ldots T})$ is unchangeable, so the states of the memory variables $Z_{0\ldots T}$ have no effect on the environment $X_{0\ldots T}.$ 

Conceivably, we can design relative inference methods where the memory states have an effect on the enviroment, such as in active learning, reinforcement learning or partially-ordered Markov decision processes. The memory states could cause a learning agent to act on the environment and change the distribution of $X_{0\ldots T}.$ Unfortunately, we will not be considering this active form of relative inference here. A complete understanding of biological intelligence must however analyze the active case.

In our passive form of relative inference, the most general case for the space of joint path distributions $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T})$ is the unconstrained space $\Delta$ where $Q$ factors as 

$$Q(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T}) = Q_*(X_{0\ldots T}) Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T}).$$ 

The factor $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ is a parameter in the optimization of $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T}).$ It is a discriminative model for approximately inferring $Z$ from $X,$ as opposed to the generative model $P(Z,X)$ for approximately sampling from $Q_*(X).$ Relative inference involves optimization over the space of discriminative models $Q(Z,X)$ and generative models $P(Z,X).$

By the chain rule of relative information,

$$I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T}) = I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T}) + I_{Q_*\Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T})$$

so a minimum value for $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T})$ will be a lower bound for the minimum value for $I_{Q_*\Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T}).$ As shown [previously](2020-10-23-machine-learning-with-relative-information/), when minimizing with $Q$ varying over the unconstrained space $\Delta$, the gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ in the bound vanishes.

## How do we perform online learning with mutable processes?

In the training of hidden Markov models, the Baum-Welch algorithm or forward-backward algorithm is often used. It requires knowledge of the enviroment from the start to the end of the time interval. An algorithm that only uses data from the environment from the start to the present is called an _online_ learning algorithm. Otherwise, the learning algorithm is said to be _offline_.

To understand the difference between online learning and offline learning in relative inference, let us consider a joint distribution 

$$Q(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T}) = Q_*(X_{0\ldots T}) Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$$ 

in the unconstrained space $\Delta.$ In the discrete time case, we may decompose the discriminative model $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ as

$$\begin{array}{rl} Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T}) & =  Q(Z_0 \vert X_{0\ldots T}) \\ & \\ & \quad  Q(Z_1 \vert Z_0,X_{0\ldots T}) \cdots \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_T \vert Z_{0\ldots (T-1)}, X_{0\ldots T}). \end{array}$$

Each of the factors in the decomposition are unconstrained, so inference for each variable $Z_t$ could depend on the entire environmental data $X_{0\ldots T}.$ Therefore, optimizing over the unconstrained space $\Delta$ corresponds to a form of offline learning where the information gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ vanishes.

For computational reasons, we may require that the discriminative model performs inference on $Z_t$ using only environmental data $X_{0\ldots (t-1)}$ from the past. We shall assume that $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ has a factorization

$$\begin{array}{rl} Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T}) & = Q(Z_0) \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_1 \vert Z_0,X_0) \cdots \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_T \vert Z_{0\ldots (T-1)}, X_{0\ldots (T-1)}) \end{array}$$

and let $\Delta_\mathcal{C} \subset \Delta$ be the subspace of distributions $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T})$ with this property.  Here, the subscript $\mathcal{C}$ denotes that we have causal constraints on the distributions. 

We may think of these factors as functionals (because they are functions of paths) parametrizing the space $\Delta_\mathcal{C}$ of distributions. 

In continuous time, the above decomposition of $Q \in \Delta_\mathcal{C}$ can be written in terms of exponentials of integrals of transition rates, giving us some system of Kolmogorov equations.

From this factorization, we can deduce by marginalization that for all $t$,

$$\begin{array}{rl} Q(Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) & = Q(X_{0\ldots t}) Q(Z_0) \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_1 \vert Z_0,X_0) \cdots \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_t \vert Z_{0\ldots (t-1)}, X_{0\ldots (t-1)}) \end{array}$$

and consequently, 

$$\begin{array}{rl}  Q(Z_{t+1}, X_{t+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) & = \displaystyle \frac{ Q(Z_{0\ldots (t+1)}, X_{0\ldots (t+1)}) }{ Q(Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) } \\ & \\ & = Q( X_{t+1} \vert X_{0\ldots t}) Q(Z_{t+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}).\end{array}$$

This implies that $Z_t$ and $X_t$ are _conditionally independent given their past_. In discrete-time, we define this to mean that 

$$Q(Z_{t+1}, X_{t+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) =  Q(Z_{t+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) Q(X_{t+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t})$$

and vice versa. In continuous time, the analogous definition is

$$Q(Z_{t\ldots t+\delta}, X_{t\ldots t+\delta} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) \rightarrow Q(Z_{t\ldots t+\delta} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}) Q(X_{t\ldots t+\delta} \vert Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t})$$

as $\delta \rightarrow 0$ from above. 

Another way to state this requirement is to say that $Z_t$ does not lie in the causal cone of $X_t$ and vice versa. There are interesting connections to [causal conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_conditions) (classification of space-time manifolds), [causal structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure) (relationships between points on a continuous space) and [causal sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets) (relationships between points on a discrete space) but we will not be exploring them in this post.

If $Z_t$ and $X_t$ are conditionally independent given their past for both $Q(Z,X)$ and $P(Z,X)$, then in discrete time, the chain rule for relative information simplifies to

$$\begin{array}{rl} &I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{n+1}, X_{n+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots n},X_{0\ldots n}) \\ & \\ &= I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{n+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots n},X_{0\ldots n}) + I_{Q\Vert P}(X_{n+1} \vert Z_{0\ldots n},X_{0\ldots n}). \end{array}$$

This chain rule has the continuous-time analogue

$$\begin{array}{rl} & \displaystyle \frac{d}{ds}I_{Q \Vert P} (Z_{0\ldots s}, X_{0\ldots s}) \\ & \\ &= \displaystyle\frac{d Z_{0\ldots s}}{ds} * \frac{\partial}{\partial Z_{0\ldots s}} I_{Q \Vert P} (Z_{0\ldots s}, X_{0\ldots s}) \\ & \\ &\quad +\displaystyle \frac{d X_{0\ldots s}}{ds} * \frac{\partial}{\partial X_{0\ldots s}} I_{Q \Vert P} (Z_{0\ldots s}, X_{0\ldots s})\end{array}$$

which mirrors the multivariate chain rule in calculus

$$\displaystyle \frac{d}{ds}f(z(s),x(s)) =\frac{dz}{ds} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} f(z,x) +\displaystyle \frac{dx}{ds} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(z,x).$$

Online learning involves minimizing over the subspace $\Delta_\mathcal{C},$ where the discriminative factors $Q(Z_t \vert Z_{0\ldots (t-1)}, X_{0\ldots (t-1)})$ depend only on information from the past. When optimizing over $\Delta_\mathcal{C},$ the information gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ might not vanish. Loosely, the gap represents _the cost of present separation_ and _the cost of future ignorance_. Indeed, if $Z_t$ and $X_t$ are not conditionally independent given their past, then either their states are entangled (e.g. $X_t$ in one state bars $Z_t$ from another state) or their dependence is coming from knowledge of the future. Since the gap vanishes when we optimize over distributions that allow such kinds of dependence, entanglements and future knowledge must be furnishing information for closing this gap.

## How do we perform relative inference with limited memory?

Suppose now that computationally, both the discriminative model and the generative model have limited memory. More precisely, the models cannot store the full histories $Z_{0\ldots t}, X_{0\ldots t}$ but they can recall the most recent states $Z_t, X_t.$ In other words, the distributions satisfy the Markov property. Hence, $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T})$ has a factorization

$$\begin{array}{rl} Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert X_{0\ldots T}) & = Q(Z_0) \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_1 \vert Z_0,X_0) \cdots \\ & \\ & \quad Q(Z_T \vert Z_{T-1}, X_{T-1}). \end{array}$$

Let $\Delta_\mathcal{M} \subset \Delta_\mathcal{C}$ be the subspace of distributions with this factorization property.  

Compared to minimizing the objective $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T})$ for $Q$ over the larger space $\Delta_\mathcal{C},$ we will incur an additional increase in the information gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T})$ due to the Markov constraint. We can think of this increase as the cost of _limited memory_.

Of course, the recent state $Z_t$ could be used to store copies of older states $Z_{t-1}, Z_{t-2}, \ldots$ but because the dimension of $Z_t$ is finite, only a limited number of those states can be stored. A smarter way is to compress those states, or to only store pertinent information about those states. 

## How do we perform relative inference with limited sensing?

For our mathematical analysis, we find it semantically convenient to assume that the process $X_{0\ldots T}$ represents the history of _every particle in the universe_ and that it is a Markov process. Some subprocesses of $X_{0\ldots T}$ will be observed during training, while other subprocesses may remain hidden. 

Observability will be determined by structures in the discriminative model $\{Q(Z\vert X)\}$ and generative model $\{P(Z, X)\}.$ If a subprocess of $X_{0\ldots T}$ is hidden, then the memory $Z_{0\ldots T}$ will be independent of the subprocess in the discriminative model. In the generative model, we can assign a trivial distribution (e.g. assigning uniform distributions or assigning probability one to some fixed state) to the hidden subprocess.

Such constraints on the discriminative model and generative model [could](2021-03-22-relative-inference-with-mutable-processes/#remark-cost-of-limited-sensing) cause the information gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T})$ to increase yet again. We can think of this increase as the cost of _limited sensing_.

The reason we say that this Markov assumption is _semantically convenient_ is as follows. We could alternatively model the universe as a joint process $X_{0\ldots T}, U_{0\ldots T}$ where $X_{0\ldots T}$ is observed and $U_{0\ldots T}$ is hidden. However, the mathematical analysis becomes notationally complicated because of the need to write down both processes. It is easier to subsume the distinction between observed and hidden under assumptions for the discriminative model and generative model.

Under this Markov assumption and under mild regularity conditions, the time-averaged relative information will be equal to the relative information rate.

$$\begin{array}{rl}  V(Q,P) &= \displaystyle \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} I_{Q \Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T}) \\ & \\ & \displaystyle = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{d}{dT}I_{Q \Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}, X_{0\ldots T}) \end{array}$$

The discrete time analogue of the relative information rate under this Markov setting is the asymptotic conditional relative information 

$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} I_{Q \Vert P}(Z_{n+1},X_{n+1}\vert Z_n, X_n).$$

Our goal is therefore to train the model by minimizing the relative information rate or conditional relative information over Markov models $\{Q \}$ and $\{ P_\theta \}$ using methods from relative inference.

Biological spiking networks need to work with the constraints of not knowing the future and having limited memory and sensing. For the remainder of this series, we will also work with these constraints.

## Remark: Cost of limited sensing 

Let $V_t$ and $U_t$ be the observed and hidden components of each $X_t.$ Suppose the generative model $P(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T})$ assigns probability one to some fixed path of $\{U_t\}.$ 

In the decomposition

$$I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T},X_{0\ldots T}) = I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T}) + I_{Q_*\Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T})$$

the above trivial assignment of probability will cause $I_{Q_*\Vert P}(X_{0\ldots T})$ to increase (unless the corresponding true distribution is also trivial).

As for the gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T}),$ we first note that the variables $U_t$ cannot provide us with any information about the states $Z_t$ under $P,$ so 

$$P(Z_{0\ldots T} \vert V_{0\ldots T}, U_{0\ldots T}) = P(Z_{0\ldots T} \vert V_{0\ldots T}).$$

When $P$ is fixed, the gap $I_{Q\Vert P}(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T})$ is minimized when $Q(Z_{0\ldots T}\vert  X_{0\ldots T})$ is as close to $P(Z_{0\ldots T} \vert X_{0\ldots T}) = P(Z_{0\ldots T} \vert V_{0\ldots T})$ as possible. Therefore, restricting $Z_{0\ldots T}$ to depend only on the observables $V_{0\ldots T}$ under $Q$ as opposed to all of $X_{0\ldots T}$ will not cause the information gap to increase. The gap will increase however if $Q$ is forced to infer $Z_{0\ldots T}$ from a strict subset of $$V_{0\ldots T}.$
