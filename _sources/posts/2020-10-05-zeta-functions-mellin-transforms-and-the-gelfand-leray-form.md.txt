# Zeta functions, Mellin transforms and the Gelfand-Leray form

We outline the similarities between zeta functions appearing in number theory and in statistical learning.

This post is a continuation from our [series](2020-08-28-motivic-information-path-integrals-and-spiking-networks/) on spiking networks, path integrals and motivic information.

### Gelfand-Leray functions

Let $\omega$ be a volume form or a form resulting from a measure on some space $W$. Let $f: W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a non-negative energy function or a Kullback-Leibler divergence. A _Gelfand-Leray form_ of $\omega$ is any differential form $\phi$ that satisfies

$$df \wedge \phi = \omega.$$

We will denote $\phi$ by $\omega /df$. See {cite}`arnold1988elementary` and §4 of {cite}`marcolli2010feynman` for expositions about the Gelfand-Leray form.

The _Gelfand-Leray function_ is

$$J(t) =\displaystyle \int_{f(w)=t} \frac{\omega}{df}.$$

These functions often have asymptotic expansions of the form

$$J(t) = \displaystyle \sum_\alpha \sum_{i=1}^d m_{\alpha,i} t^\alpha (\log t)^{i-1}.$$

### Zeta functions

Informally, zeta functions are complex functions of the form

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \sum_\lambda m_\lambda \lambda^{-z}$$

where the sum is over some possibly infinite (multi-)set of complex numbers $\lambda$ and the coefficients $m_\lambda$ are complex.

For example, the Riemann zeta function is

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-z}.$$

Zeta functions often have analytic continuations to the whole complex plane, and possess Laurent expansions of the form

$$\zeta(z) = \zeta_0(z) + \sum_\alpha \sum_{i=1}^d c_{\alpha i} (z-\alpha)^{-i}$$

where $\zeta_0(z)$ is holomorphic and the $\alpha$ are the poles.

A zeta function can often be written as the Mellin transform

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} J(t) dt = \int_W f(w)^{z-1} \omega$$

of a function $J(t)$, and $J(t)$ is often some kind of Gelfand-Leray function.

For example, $\zeta(z) = \sum_\lambda m_\lambda \lambda^{-z}$ is the Mellin transform

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty \theta(t) t^{z-1} dt$$

of the theta function

$$\theta(t) = \displaystyle \sum_{\lambda} m_\lambda e^{- \lambda t}.$$

However, I do not know if the theta function can be expressed as the Gelfand-Leray function of a differential form with respect to an energy function.

Zeta functions are also useful for defining infinite products {cite}`manin1995lectures`

$$Z = \displaystyle \prod_\lambda \lambda^{m_\lambda}$$

which we define to be

$$Z = \exp \left( - \zeta'(0)\right)$$

where

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \sum_\lambda m_\lambda \lambda^{-z}.$$

Indeed, for finite sums, we see that

$$\zeta'(0) = - \displaystyle \sum_\lambda m_\lambda \log \lambda.$$

### Statistical Learning

In statistical learning, given a prior $\omega = \psi(w)dw$ on the parameters $w$ of a statistical model $p: W \rightarrow \Delta,$ and given the relative information $K(w)$ to the true distribution $q$ from the model distribution $p(w),$ the Gelfand-Leray function

$$J(t) = \displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \int_{0 \leq K(w) \leq t} \psi(w) dw$$

is called the state density function {cite}`watanabe2009algebraic`.

The zeta function of the statistical model is

$$\zeta(z) = \int_W K(w)^z \psi(w) dw = \int_0^\infty t^z J(t)dt$$

which (up to some linear change of variable in $z$) is the Mellin transform of the state density function $J(t).$

### Number Theory

In number theory, we have the notorious Riemann zeta function which becomes more interesting {cite}`baez2005week` if we write it as

$$\zeta(z) = \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(n^2\right)^{-\frac{z}{2}}.$$

This representation suggests that we study the infamous Jacobi theta function

$$\theta(t) =\displaystyle \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-n^2 (\pi t) }.$$

Note the extra factor of $\pi$ in the exponent and the changing of the lower bound of summation to $-\infty$.

The modularity of the theta function

$$\theta(t) = \displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \theta\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)$$

is the crux behind the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function

$$\Lambda(z) = \Lambda(1-z)$$

where $\Lambda(z) = 2^{-1/2}\pi^{-z/2}\Gamma(z/2)\zeta(z).$

The function $\Lambda(z)$ itself can be written {cite}`deninger1991gamma` as the infinite product

$$(\frac{z}{2\pi})(\frac{z-1}{2\pi})\Lambda(z) = \prod_\rho \frac{z-\rho}{2\pi}$$

over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. This infinite product is in turn expressible using another zeta function and theta function.

The Hurwitz zeta function

$$\zeta_s(z) = \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+s)^{-z}$$

is associated to the theta function $\theta_s(t) = e^{-st} \theta(t)$ where

$$\theta(t) =\sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-nt} = \frac{1}{1-e^{-t}}.$$

Note that the Riemann zeta function is the special case $\zeta_1(z).$

The Hasse-Weil zeta function of a smooth absolutely irreducible curve $V$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is

$$\begin{array}{rl} Z_{V}(z) &= \displaystyle \sum_\alpha \left(q^{ \deg(\alpha)}\right)^{-z} \\ & \\ &= \exp\left(\displaystyle\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac{\# V(\mathbb{F}_{q^m})}{m}q^{-zm} \right) \end{array}$$

where the first sum is over effective zero-cycles $\alpha$. The zeta function can also be written as

$$(1-q^{-z})(1-q^{1-z})Z_{V}(z) = \displaystyle \prod_{j=1}^{2g} (1-\phi_j q^{-z})$$

where $g$ is the genus of $V$ and each $\phi_j$ is an algebraic integer. Each of the factors can be written as infinite products

$$1-\lambda q^{-z} = \displaystyle \prod_{\rho \vert  q^\rho = \lambda} \frac{\log q}{2\pi i}(z-\rho).$$

which is in turn expressible using another zeta function and theta function.
