<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

The purpose of this website is to make available unpolished code that we wrote to
  compute tropical secant graphs. However, there is no guarantee of
  the correctness of the code, so use at your own risk.

<h2>Research Paper</h2>

The research paper "Tropical Secant Graphs of Monomial Curves" can be found <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3364">here</a>.

<h2>Singular Library</h2>

The <tt>Singular</tt> library can be downloaded here: <a
href="tropsec.lib">tropsec.lib</a>. <br>
<br>
Put this file in your work directory and type the command
<blockquote><tt>> LIB "tropsec.lib";</tt></blockquote>
when you start your <tt>Singular</tt> session. 

<h2>Tropical Secant Graph</h2>

To compute the <i>tropical secant graph</i> described in Definition 6.6 of the paper, use the command <blockquote><tt>list gph = tropsec(exps);</tt></blockquote> where <tt>exps</tt> is an integer vector of exponents describing a monomial curve. This graph encodes the tropicalization of the first secant variety of the monomial curve described by <tt>exps</tt>. The vector <tt>exps</tt> must have at least four entries, start with zero as the first entry, be strictly increasing and the gcd of all the entries must be one.<br>
<br>
It returns a list <tt>gph</tt> with two integer matrices.
<ul>
  <li><tt>gph[1]</tt> is an ordered list of rays in the tropical secant
  graph. Each row of the matrix gives the coordinates of a ray.
  <li><tt>gph[2]</tt> is an ordered list of edges in the tropical secant graph. Each row corresponds to an edge, and has three entries <tt>i, j, k</tt>. The entries <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> are indices of the rays defining the edge while the entry <tt>k</tt> is the weight of the edge.
</ul>

<h2>Groebner Tropical Secant Graph</h2>

To compute the <i>Groebner tropical secant graph</i> described in
Definition 6.12, Theorem 6.13 (dim 6), Theorem 6.14 (dim 5), Lemma 7.3
(dim 4), Theorem 7.4 (dim 4) of the paper, use the command
<blockquote><tt>list gph = grobsec(exps);</tt></blockquote> where
<tt>exps</tt> is an integer vector of exponents describing a monomial
curve.<br>
<br>
It returns a list <tt>gph</tt> with the following items.

<ul>
<li><tt>gph[1]</tt> is a list of all the coordinates of the nodes
<li><tt>gph[2]</tt> is a list of the edges in the form "i,j,m" which means the edge from node i to node j has weight m.
<li><tt>gph[3]</tt> is a list of all the names of the nodes
<li><tt>gph[4]</tt> is a list of all the names of the edges 
<li><tt>gph[5]</tt> is a list of all the partial overlaps and internal crossings predicted by the paper which makes it a groebner tropical secant graph.
</ul>
Lastly, if you try our example "0,30,45,55,78", it says "integer
overflow error" because I did not use large integers to program this
code but just standard integers (i.e. between -65536 and 65536). I
could rewrite my code to do that, but that would take time, so I
decided to leave it alone. <br>

<tt>
> LIB "tropsec.lib";<br>
> intvec exps = 0,2,5,8,10;<br>
> list gph = grobsec(exps);<br>
> gph;<br>
