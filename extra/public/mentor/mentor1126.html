<h3>Survey on volumes of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds and manifolds</h3>
A hyperbolic n-orbifold is a quotient of n-dimensional hyperbolic space by a discrete group of isometries.
Jorgensen and Thurston proved that the volumes of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds form a well-ordered set.
Recently, the minimal volume 3-orbifolds and minimal volume orientable 3-manifolds have been
identified. The smallest volume manifold is known as the Weeks-Matveev-Fomenko manifold, with
volume .9427..., and has been conjectured to be minimal volume since the '80s. We'll survey these
topics, and indicate some of the techniques that go into proving them.<br>
