Open systems compose by refinement or hole-filling, where a typed hole can only be filled by an open system of the right spec. An open system in some representation can also be translated (transported, projected or lifted) to some open system in another representation.

(or Kullback-Leibler divergence) is all you need.

facets of learning algorithms and their ability
to generalize. In this talk, I will outline two
ongoing projects involving relative information.
The first project explores the information theory
of time series, for the purpose of understanding
language models and reinforcement learning. Using
relative information rate, we derive stochastic

with memory. The second project explores cohomological
generalizations of relative information, building on
recent work by Pierre Baudot and Daniel Bennequin

new tools for studying non-statistical spaces,
by analyzing the level sets of generalized
relative information and their transforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Imagine we have a model D(w) of a dynamical system with states s \in S, that is parametrized by some weight w \in W. Each state s comes with a set N(s) \subset S of neighbors and an associated energy function E(s'|s,w) \in \mathbb{R} that assigns an energy to each neighbor s' \in N(s).For simplicity, we assume the following dynamics: when the system is in state s, it picks the neighbor s' with the lowest energy E(s'|s,w) and jumps to state s' in the next time step (more to come later about what we mean by time step).</summary>

    <summary>So far, our definition of relative information studies the divergence between real-valued measures. In this post, we will explore motivic measures which take values more generally in some ring R, and have some fun applying motivic relative information to zeta functions.This post is a continuation from our series on spiking networks, path integrals and motivic information.</summary>

    <title>Processes and variety maximization</title>
    <updated>2020-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a theory about processes, about the sequences and causal relations among &lt;em&gt;things that happen&lt;/em&gt;, not the inherent properties of &lt;em&gt;things that are.&lt;/em&gt; The fundamental ingredient is what we call an “event.” Events are things that happen at a single place and time; at each event there’s some momentum, energy, charge or other various physical quantity that’s measurable. The event has relations with the rest of the universe, and that set of relations constitutes its “view” of the universe. Rather than describing an isolated system in terms of things that are measured from the outside, we’re taking the universe as constituted of relations among events. The idea is to try to reformulate physics in terms of these views from the inside, what it looks like from inside the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many views, and each one has only partial information about the rest of the universe. We propose as a principle of dynamics that each view should be unique. That idea comes from Leibniz’s principle of the identity of indiscernibles. Two events whose views are exactly mappable onto each other are the same event, by definition. So each view is unique, and you can measure how distinct one is from another by defining a quantity called the “variety.” If you think of a node on a graph, you can go one step out, two steps out, three steps out. Each step gives you a neighborhood — the one-step neighborhood, the two-step neighborhood, the three-step neighborhood. So for any two events you can ask: How many steps do you have to go out until their views diverge? In what neighborhood are they different? The fewer steps you have to go, the more distinguishable the views are from one another. The idea in this theory is that the laws of physics — the dynamics of the system — work to maximize variety. That principle — that nature wants to maximize variety — actually leads, within the framework I’ve been describing, to the Schrödinger equation, and hence to a recovery, in an appropriate limit, of quantum mechanics.” - Les Smolin&lt;/p&gt;

Personally, I am more interested in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine"&gt;Boltzmann machines&lt;/a&gt; because they represent a class of discrete &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/research/ebm/"&gt;energy models&lt;/a&gt; where the energy is quadratic. The dynamics of the model bears a lot of resemblance to those of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network"&gt;Hopfield networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model"&gt;Ising models&lt;/a&gt;. As an aside, normal distributions are continuous energy models where the energy is quadratic and positive definite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the energy of the model is a polynomial of higher degree (e.g. cubic, quartic), then the model is &lt;em&gt;hierarchical&lt;/em&gt;. They are a kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model"&gt;graphical model&lt;/a&gt; where the underlying graph is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex"&gt;simplicial complex&lt;/a&gt; (a special type of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph"&gt;hypergraph&lt;/a&gt;). Here are some slides and papers on hierachical models:&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a key statistical model used in deep learning. They are special form of Boltzmann machines where the underlying graph is a bipartite graph. Personally, I am more interested in Boltzmann machines because they represent a class of discrete energy models where the energy is quadratic. The dynamics of the model bears a lot of resemblance to those of Hopfield networks and Ising models. As an aside, normal distributions are continuous energy models where the energy is quadratic and positive definite.If the energy of the model is a polynomial of higher degree (e.g. cubic, quartic), then the model is hierarchical. They are a kind of graphical model where the underlying graph is a simplicial complex (a special type of hypergraph). Here are some slides and papers on hierachical models:</summary>

    <title>Studying model asymptotics with singular learning theory</title>
    <updated>2012-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singular statistical models occur frequently in machine learning and computational biology. An important prob-lem in the learning theory of singular models is determin-ing their asymptotic behavior for massive data sets. In this talk, we give a brief introduction to Sumio Watanabe’s Singular Learning Theory, as outlined in his book “Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory.” We will also explore the rich algebraic geometry and combinatorics that arise from studying the asymptotics of Bayesian integrals.&lt;/p&gt;
