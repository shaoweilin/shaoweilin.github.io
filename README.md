# Shaowei Lin

I am a mathematician working on the statistical learning theory of spiking neural networks and on dependent type theories for machine reasoning. This repository contains the source code for my [website](https://shaoweilin.github.io/).

## Website

As a big MyST fan, I was really inspired by Chris Holdgraf's [website](https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/). This source code was modified from [his](https://github.com/choldgraf/choldgraf.github.io).

## Install

1. Ensure `.gitignore` file and `.github` directory are copied. 
2. [Install](https://giscus.app/) `giscus` app on Github.
3. Add `Blog comments` to Discussions category on GitHub.
4. Configure `giscus` and add to `_templates/layout.html`.
5. A `gh-pages` branch will be created after the files are committed.
6. Set `GitHub > Settings > Pages > Source` to root of `gh-pages`.
